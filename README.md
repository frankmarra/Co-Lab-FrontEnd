## Description:

#### How many unfinished songs do you have? The answer is always too many. Co-Lab is here to help. Upload your unfinished tracks with a description, genre, descriptive metadata, and what the song needs. Other Co-Lab users who are looking to collaborate can find your tracks by genre, metadata, and/or needs. If they like what they hear, they can send you a message asking to collaborate.
