## Description:

#### How many unfinished songs do you have? The answer is always too many. Co-Lab is here to help. Upload your unfinished tracks with a description, genre, descriptive metadata, and what the song needs. Other Co-Lab users who are looking to collaborate can find your tracks by genre, metadata, and/or needs. If they like what they hear, they can send you a message asking to collaborate.

#### When you first arrive at the Co-lab, there are a few things you can do. If you aren't sure if you want to create an account, feel free to look around. There are four random Co-lab users displayed, and you can listen to one of their songs, or click on their cards to go to their user page. You can also click on the explore link to go to the search page. From there, you can search by any of the filters or by the name of a track. A list of songs matching your query will be displayed and you can listen, or click on the creator's name to go to their page.

#### If you decide to create an account, click on the "Sign up" button and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### You will then be directed to your user page. Here you can update your user information to include a user picture, banner, and/or spotify playlist of some of your completed tracks that will be displayed on your public page. You can also write a small bio to share a bit about yourself.

#### You also now have the ability to collaborate with other users. Now their tracks will have a little email icon that you can click on. This will bring up a pre-filled email form that you can add to and send to the other user. Just make sure they have your Co-lab ID.

#### Likewise, you will also start getting emails of other users wanting to collaborate with you! If you decide to collaborate, go back to your user page, click on create Co-lab, and follow the instructions. It's that simple. Now you will have a new option allowing you to view your Co-labs. Click on it, and it will display them all!

#### That's all for now. Expect more features to be added in the future. Have fun, and let us know when you create the next #1 hit!
